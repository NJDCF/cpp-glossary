<p><b>"Abridged Complaint for Guardianship" or "Abridged Complaint" </b></p>

<p>means a legal document that uses standardized language and incorporates past pleadings, prior protective services court orders, and court reports, to support a TPR action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15. The Abridged Complaint provides notice of the family's history and circumstances, and states the services CP&amp;P arranged in an attempt to resolve the problems prior to initiating the TPR action. The Abridged Complaint provides adequate notice to both parents explaining the relief sought and the basis for that relief. When filing an Abridged Complaint, "Appendix A" is filed with the complaint in lieu of the "Evidence Packet." The Abridged Complaint provides an efficient alternative to the timely preparation of a detailed and lengthy full Termination of Parental Rights Complaint. <b>(II M 300.3)</b> </p>

<p>means- The withholding of appropriate nutrition, hydration, medication or other medically indicated treatment from a disabled infant with a life-threatening condition, including a born alive infant. Medically indicated treatment includes medical care which is most likely to relieve or correct all life-threatening conditions and evaluations or consultations necessary to assure that sufficient information has been gathered to make informed medical decisions. Nutrition, hydration, and medication, as appropriate for the infant's needs, are medically indicated for all disabled infants. Other types of treatment are not medically indicated when:</p>
